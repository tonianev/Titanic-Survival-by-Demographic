# Summary:
The provided Titanic dataset contains the personal and overall demographic information of 891 individuals that were aboard the Titanic. Using this information, I aim to explore and visualize the demographic distribution of all passangers aboard the ship as well as their survival rate. 

# Design:
Initially, I wanted to get a good overall visual of the way the data was distributed across each variable and spent a fair amount of time brainstorming which relationships would be most interesting to explore. After gathering a substantial amount of peer feedback it became clear to me that the most interesting theme in the dataset was rate of survival. Thus, I made sure the very first slide the viewer saw was a clear separation between survivor and non-survivor count followed by a gender split of the survivors. I used Tableauâ€™s treemap visualization for this because I felt it was well suited to convey the sample size difference between the two variables. The next slides showed the average male and female survivor count based on embark location, survivor counts by age group and the average survivor count by ticket class. For these graphs I once again filtered the sample by gender to add some interactivity and extra information to the graphs.
