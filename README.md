#Summary:
The provided Titanic dataset contains the personal and overall demographic information of 891 individuals 
that were aboard the Titanic. Using this information I aim to visualize to the reader the demographic distribution of 
the individuals as well as their survival rate. During the evacuation of the sinking ship women and children were given 
preference significantly skewing the survivor demographic. This notion can be seen in nearly every demographical subset of 
the 891 individual sample.

#Design:
Initially I wanted to get a good overall visual of the way the data was distributed between each variable. Thus, my initial
story was more exploratory in nature and was looking to brainstorm which relationships would be most interesting to explore. 
After receiving feedback it was clear to me that the common theme in the data set was survival. For the final story I wanted 
to begin from a more general starting point and guide the user through some of the survival demographics in the dataset. 
Therefore, I made the first slide a separation between survivors and non-survivors, after which I split the survivors by gender.
I used Tableauâ€™s treemap visualization for this because I felt it was well suited to convey the sample size difference between 
the two variables. The next slides showed the average male and female survivor count based on embark location, survivor counts by 
age group and the average survivor count by ticket class. For these graphs I once again filtered the sample by gender to add some 
interactivity and extra information to the graphs.
